I am sharing PowerBl Desktop project, AdventureWorks Report, which provides insights into the overall performance of AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories.

ℹ️The steps involved in the analysis are:

1. Data Extraction: Gathering all the data to PowerQuery.
2. Data Cleaning: Checking for duplicate values, errors, and patterns.
3. Data Transformation: Adding extra columns to calculate certain measures such as the Start of the Week, Start of the Month, Year, and Average Retail Price, among others.
4. Data Modeling: Building one-to-many relationships between data tables.
5. Data Processing/Manipulation: Creating new calculated columns and measures such as Total
Transactions, Total Profit, Total Returns, Return Rate, Revenue Target, 90-Day Revenue, etc
6. Data Visualization: Building an interactive dashboard with KPIs, trends, charts, and a matrix.
